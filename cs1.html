<H1 style="color:purple">Computer - Basics</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">What is a Computer??<br>
• The word “Computer” comes from the word “compute” which 
means to calculate.<br>
• A computer is an electronic device, which stores and processes 
data to give meaningful information.<br>
• Takes input, process it and produce output</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Computer - characteristics</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Speed: Computer having more speed to perform jobs 
instantaneously.<br>
• Accuracy: The computers are perfect, accurate and precise. <br>
• Automatic: A computer works automatically, once programs are 
stored and data are given to it.<br>
• Endurance: A computer works continuously and will not get tired 
and will not suffer from lack of concentration.<br>
• Versatility: A computer can be put to work in various fields.<br>
• Reduction of cost: Though initial investment may be high, 
computer substantially reduces the cost of transaction.</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Computer - types</h1>
<font style="font-size:20"><dl>
<dt>PC (Personal 
Computer)</dt><dd>It is a single user computer system having 
moderately powerful microprocessor.</dd>
<dt>Workstation</dt><dd>It is also a single user computer system, similar to 
personal computer however has more powerful 
microprocessor.</dd>
<dt>Mini Computer</dt><dd>It is a multi-user computer system, capable of 
supporting hundreds of users simultaneously.
</dd>
<dt>Main Frame</dt><dd>It is a multi-user computer system, capable of 
supporting hundreds of users simultaneously. 
Software technology is different from minicomputer.</dd>
<dt>Supercomputer</dt><dd>It is an extremely fast computer, which can execute 
hundreds of millions of instructions per second.

<H1 style="color:purple">Classification of Computers</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Processing Capability<br>
• Type of Computation<br>
• Area of Application</p>

<H1 style="color:purple">Based on Processing capabilty</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">Computers are classified based on their capabilities such as size,
operating speed, storage capacity and cost, are :<br>• Micro Computer<br>
• Mini Computers<br>
• Main Frame Computers<br>
• Super Computers</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Based on the Type of Computation</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Based on the principle of computation (processing); computers are
classified into:<br>
• Analog Computer<br>
• Digital Computer<br>
• Hybrid Computer</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Based on the Area of Application</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Based on the area in which the computers used, they are classified
into:<br>
• General Purpose Computer<br>
• Special Purpose Computer

<H1 style="color:purple">Hardware</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Hardware refers to all visible and touchable devices that are
assembled together to build a computer system.<br>
• these include all physical parts namely input devices, CPU, output
devices, memory, buses and power supply.<br>
• Hardware refers to all visible devices that are assembled together to
build a computer system these include various<br>
1.input devices,<br>
 2.central processing unit,<br>
 3.output devices, and<br>
 4.storage</p><br>
<H1 style="color:purple">Software</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Software is a generic term for organized collection of computer
data and instructions.<br>
• These instructions are called as programs and collectively,
programs are termed as software.<br>

• responsible for controlling, integrating and managing the hardware
components of a computer to accomplish specific tasks.<br>
• tells the computer what to do and how to do it.
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Applications of Computers</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">
Medicine and Health Care<br>
• There has been an increasing use of computers in the field of medicine.<br>
• Now doctors are using computers right from diagnosing the illness to
monitoring a patient's status during a complex surgery.<br>
• By using automated imaging techniques, doctors are able to look
inside a person's body and can study each organ in detail (such as CAT
scans or MRI scans), which was not possible a few years ago.<br>
Engineering Architecture/Manufacturing<br>
• The architects and engineers are extensively using computers in
designing and drawings.<br>
• Computers can create objects that can be viewed from all the three
dimensions.<br>
• By using techniques like virtual reality, architects can explore houses
that have been designed but not built.<br>
Entertainment<br>
• Computers are finding greater use in entertainment industry.<br>
• They are used to control the images and sounds.<br>
• Special effects, which mesmerize the audience, would not have been
possible without computers.<br>
• In addition, computerized animation and colorful graphics have
modernized the film industry.<br>
Communication<br>
• E-mail is one of the communication media in which computer is used.<br>
• The benefit of e-mail service is that while transferring the messages it
saves time, saves paper, and so on.<br>
• Moreover, the person who is receiving the messages can read the
messages whenever he is free and can save it, reply it, forward it or
delete it from the computer.<br>
Publishing<br>
• Computers have created a field known as DTP (Desktop Publishing).<br>
• In DTP with the help of a computer and a laser printer one can perform
the publishing job all but oneself.<br>
Banking<br>
• In the field of banking and finance, computers are extensively used.<br>
• People can use the ATM (Automated Teller Machine) services 24
hours of the day in order to deposit and withdraw cash.<br>
• When the different branches of the bank are connected through
computer networks, then the inter branch transactions such as cheque
and draft can be done by the computers without any delay.<br>
