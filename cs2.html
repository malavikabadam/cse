<H1 style="color:purple">Computer Hardware</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20"> Hardware refers to all visible devices that are 
assembled together to build a computer system,
these include various :<br>
 input devices, <br>
 central processing unit, <br>
 output devices, and <br>
 storage</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Input Unit</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20"> Input devices are electromechanical devices that allow the 
user to feed information into the computer .<br>
 for analysis, storage and to give commands to the central 
processing unit.<br> 
 Computer accepts input in two ways, either manually or 
directly. <br>
 In case of manual data entry, by using keyboard and mouse. <br>
 While, in case of direct entry, automatically from a source 
document (like barcode, reading a file content). <br>
 Some of the commonly used input devices are keyboard, 
pointing devices like mouse and joystick, and scanners.
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Central Processing Unit</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20"> The central processing unit (CPU) referred to as the
"brain" of a computer system, converts data (input) into
meaningful information (output).<br>
 A CPU controls all internal and external devices,
performs arithmetic and logic operations.<br>
 It also controls the usage of memory to store data and
instructions, and controls the operations.<br>
 The central processing unit consists of three main
subsystems:<br>
1.the Arithmetic/Logic Unit<br>
2.the Control Unit and<br>
3.the Registers</p><br>
<H1 style="color:purple">Arithmetic/Logic Unit(ALU) Unit</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20"> The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) contains the electronic
circuitry that executes all arithmetic and logical
operations on the data made available to it.<br>
 The data required to perform the arithmetic and logical
functions are inputs from the designated registers.<br>
 ALU comprises of two units: Arithmetic Unit and Logic
Unit.<br>
 Arithmetic Unit: responsible for performing the actual
computing and carrying out the arithmetic calculations, such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
 Logic Unit: performs logical operations based on the instructions
provided to it.
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Control Unit</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20"> This unit checks the correctness of sequence of 
operations<br>
 It fetches program instruction from the primary storage 
unit, interprets them, and ensures correct execution of 
the program. <br>
 It also controls the input/output devices and directs 
the overall functioning of the other units of the 
computer.
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Output Unit</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20"> Just as humans communicate with computers through input 
devices, the computer can communicate with human beings 
using output devices. <br>
 Output devices take the machine-coded output results from 
the CPU and convert them into a form that is easily readable 
by human.<br>
 The outputs, which can be easily understood and used by 
human beings, are in the form of hard copy and soft copy. <br>
 The physical form of output is known as hard copy. The 
electronic version of an output, which usually resides in 
computer memory and/or on disk, is known as soft copy.<br>
 Some of the commonly used output devices are monitors, 
printers, plotters, and audio response.
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Storage Unit</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20"> The storage/memory unit provides the space to store 
the data or instruction and the processed data.<br>
 Memory refers to the electronic holding place for 
instructions and data.<br> 
 Some data will be required instantaneously, while 
others may not be needed for extended periods.<br>
 Likewise, CPU requires memory to handle the 
intermediate results and to store the final output. <br>
 Hence, we can classify memory into two broad 
categories: <br>
1.primary memory (to handle the data) and <br>
2.secondary memory (to store the output)<br>
 Primary Memory: Also known as main memory, stores 
data and instructions for processing. <br>
 Primary memory can be further classified into <br>
1.random access memory (RAM) and <br>
2.read only memory (ROM)<br>
 Secondary Memory: Also known as auxiliary memory or 
external memory is used for storing instructions 
(software programs) and data, since main memory 
temporary and limited in size. <br>
 This memory is least expensive and has much larger 
storage capacity than primary memory.
