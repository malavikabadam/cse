<H1 style="color:purple">Software</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">Software can be categorized as:<br>
• System software and<br>
• Application software</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">System Software</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• refers to any computer program whose purpose is to help the user to
run the computer system.<br>
• Used to control, integrate and manage the hardware components of
the system.<br>
• acts as an interface between the computer hardware and the
software application.<br>
• Examples. Operating systems, utility software, language translators
and device drivers.
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Operating Software</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• operating system manages the computer system and performs
functions related to the input, processing, output, and storage of
information.<br>
• Examples, Windows 7, 8, Mac OS, Linux<br>
• The functions of operating systems are:
• User interface, Process management, Memory, File and Security
management.</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Utility Software</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• refers to the small programs performing some specific tasks.<br>
• it enhance, support and secure existing acts as an interface between
the computer hardware and the software application.<br>
• Functions are:<br>
• Disk management programs (disk defragment, disk formatting tools)<br>
• File management<br>
• Data recovery<br>
• Anti virus
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Language Translators</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Computers only understand a language consisting of 0’s and 1’s
called machine language.<br>
• Therefore, a tool was required which could translate a program
written in a programming language to machine language.<br>
• Depending on the programming language used, language
translators are divided into three major categories: compilers,
interpreter, and assembler.
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Application Software</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">• Application Software is a set of programs for a specific application.<br>
• Application software is useful for word processing, accounting, and
producing statistical report, Graphics, Excel and Data Base.<br>
• Programming languages COBOL, FORTRAN, C, C++, Java,
Python.<br>
• Application software includes the followings:<br>
• Word processing<br>
• Spreadsheet<br>
• DBMS<br>
• Presentation software<br>
• Graphics and Multimedia Software<br>
</p>
<H1 style="color:purple">Application Software Examples</h1>
<p style="font=family:arial;font-size:20">Word processing<br>
• A word processing program can be used to create almost any kind of printed
document.<br>
• Word processors are the most widely used of all software applications because they are
central to communication.<br>
• Used to create a document, store it electronically on a disk , display, modify it by
entering commands and print in on a printer.<br>
• Eg. MS word, Word Perfect.<br>
Spreadsheet<br>
• Spreadsheet software provides a means of organizing, calculating, and presenting
financial, statistical, and other numerical information.<br>
• Businesses find spreadsheets particularly useful for evaluating alternative scenarios.<br>
• The spreadsheet uses “what if” calculations to evaluate possibilities.<br>
• For the individual user, spreadsheets fulfill many purposes, including:<br>
• Preparing and analyzing personal or business budgets<br>
• Analyzing financial situations<br>
• Preparing personal financial statements<br>
• Estimating taxes<br>
• Eg. MS Excel, Lotus 123 etc.,<br>
DBMS<br>
• A DBMS is a collection of programs that enable user to store, modify and
extract information from a database.<br>
• The information entered using such a software will become a record in a
table. Users can add, remove, or change the stored data.<br>
• Example of DBMS applications: Computerized library system, Auto teller
Machine (ATM).<br>
• Eg. MS access, MS SQL Server, Oracle<br>
Presentation Software<br>
• Presentation graphics software allows users to create computerized slide
shows that combine text, numbers, animation, graphics, sounds, and
videos.<br>
• A slide is an individual document that is created in presentation graphics
software.<br>
• For example, an instructor may use a slide show to accompany a lecture to
make it more engaging and informative.<br>
• Microsoft PowerPoint and Corel Presentations are examples.<br>
Graphics and Multimedia Software<br>
• Graphics and multimedia software allows both professional and
home users to work with graphics, video, and audio.<br>
• A variety of applications software is focused in this area, including
painting and drawing software, image-editing software, video and
audio editing software, Web authoring software, and computer-aided design (CAD) software.
